    <h1>My Iguana</h1>
    <p>Why do people own green iguanas? Aside from the fun of showing off a little dinosaur resting comfortably on your shoulder, what is it that is so fascinating about having a huge untamed lizard that can grow up to 6 ft long and has a tendency to bite.Contrary to what many people think, a green iguana makes a unique and amazing pet. Just like any other pet, you need to learn what is required for your iguana to stay healthy and for you to avoid any frustration that you may encounter down the road. Once you establish a suitable diet and environment for this creature to thrive, the caring and maintenance is relatively simple.</p>
